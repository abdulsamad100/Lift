# Lift Simulator

A simple lift simulator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* A graphical representation of a lift that can be controlled using buttons
* Four floors to navigate between (Ground, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd)
* Uses Bootstrap for styling and layout

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser
2. Click on the buttons to navigate between floors
3. The lift will animate to the selected floor

## Files

* `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project
* `style.css`: The CSS file for styling and layout
* `app.js`: The JavaScript file for handling button clicks and animating the lift
* `Lift-Open.png`: The image file for the lift Open
* `Lift-Close.png`: The image file for the lift Close

## Dependencies

* Bootstrap 5.3.3 (via CDN)

## Notes

* This project uses a simple animation to simulate the lift moving between floors. In a real-world application, you would likely want to use a more sophisticated animation library or framework.
